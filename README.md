# 100-days-of-code
Heard about this through a guy who is good at coding and so I thought it would make me better at coding if I tried it too.
- Day 0: hello
- - it is past my bed time but I said I'd do this tonight so it's done. My calendar is marked for the next 100 days. By the end I want to be fluent in Node, Lambda, DynamoDB, and some other things. Tomorrow I will either start a Udemy course or a personal project. I plan to do a little bit of both and some bookwork before this is over.

- Day 1:
- - Working on a personal project at https://github.com/StphnRssll/youtube-caption-search
- - - learned a good bit about nextjs. Can now load environment variables and I have the Next.js internal api (better name for this?). Seems like I can build my whole app in this instead of using a seperate node proejct. neat.
- - got api to return an environment variable
- - got client to render api response

- questions:
- - How do I load an environment variable from .env or .env.local? I can only load from next.config.js
- - If I want my app to be low-cost to run, shouldn't I opt for client-side fetching and rendering? I don't need SEO for the pages that I'm loading.

- next steps:
- - want to answer the above questions
