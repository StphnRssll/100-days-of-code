# 100-days-of-code
Heard about this through a guy who is good at coding and so I thought it would make me better at coding if I tried it too.
- Day 1: hello
- - it is past my bed time but I said I'd do this tonight so it's done. My calendar is marked for the next 100 days. By the end I want to be fluent in Node, Lambda, DynamoDB, and some other things. Tomorrow I will either start a Udemy course or a personal project. I plan to do a little bit of both and some bookwork before this is over.
