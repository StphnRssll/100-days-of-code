# 100-days-of-code
Heard about this through a guy who is good at coding and so I thought it would make me better at coding if I tried it too.
- Day 0: hello
- - it is past my bed time but I said I'd do this tonight so it's done. My calendar is marked for the next 100 days. By the end I want to be fluent in Node, Lambda, DynamoDB, and some other things. Tomorrow I will either start a Udemy course or a personal project. I plan to do a little bit of both and some bookwork before this is over.

- Day 1:
- - Working on a personal project at https://github.com/StphnRssll/youtube-caption-search
- - today I set up the node.js back end following [this guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-react-app-with-a-node-backend-the-complete-guide/) and the nextjs front end following (this guide)[https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup].
